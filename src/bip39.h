/**

    @brief Generate a BIP-0039 mnemonic phrase.

    This function generates a BIP-0039 mnemonic phrase from a given entropy
    value, or generates a new entropy value if none is provided.

    @param ent_bits The number of bits of entropy to use.
    @param lang     The language of the wordlist to use.
    @param ent      A pointer to the entropy value to use, or NULL to generate
                    a new entropy value. If provided, the entropy value must
                    be ent_bits bits long.

    @return A pointer to the generated mnemonic phrase, or NULL if an error
            occurred. The caller is responsible for freeing the memory.
